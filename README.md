# Algorithms
> This repository contains solutions **[ in C++ ]** of a problem using different techniques like Dynamic Programming , Greedy Algorithms , Divide and Conquer , Backtracking etc.

## Here's some techniques to solve different kind of problems.

## Dynamic Programming
> Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc). Each of the subproblem solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its input parameters, so as to facilitate its lookup. So the next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time. This technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called memoization.

### Here's some problems and their solution(s):

## Greedy Algorithms
> A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

## Divide and Conquer
> A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.
> - Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
> - Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
> - Combine: Appropriately combine the answers

## Backtracking
> Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
