## There is a street of length n and as we know it has two sides. Therefore a total of 2 * n spots are available. In each of these spots either a house or an office can be built with following 2 restrictions:
-  No two offices on the same side of the street can be adjacent.
- No two offices on different sides of the street can be exactly opposite to each other i.e. they canâ€™t overlook each other.
## There are no restrictions on building houses and each spot must either have a house or office.
## Given length of the street n, find total number of ways to build the street.
