## Permutation refers to the process of arranging all the members of a given set to form a sequence. The number of permutations on a set of n elements is given by n! , where “!” represents factorial.
## The Permutation Coefficient represented by P(n, k) is used to represent the number of ways to obtain an ordered subset having k elements from a set of n elements.
