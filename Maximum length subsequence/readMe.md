# Maximum length subsequence with difference between adjacent elements as either 0 or 1
## Given an array of n integers. The problem is to find maximum length of the subsequence with difference between adjacent elements as either 0 or 1.

**Examples:
Input : arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6, 5, 8}
Output : 5
The subsequence is {5, 6, 7, 6, 5}.
Input : arr[] = {-2, -1, 5, -1, 4, 0, 3}
Output : 4
The subsequence is {-2, -1, -1, 0}**
