## Given an array of n integers. You are given q queries. Write a program to print floor value of mean in range l to r for each query in a new line.
```
Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        q = 3
        0 2
        1 3
        0 4
Output : 2
         3
         3
Here for 0 to 2 (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2

Input : arr[] = {6, 7, 8, 10}
        q = 2
        0 3
        1 2
Output : 7
         7
```
