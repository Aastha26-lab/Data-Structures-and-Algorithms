## Given an array arr that has numbers appearing twice or once. The task is to identify numbers that occurred only once in the array.

Note: Duplicates appear side by side every time. Might be few numbers can occur one time and just assume this is a right rotating array (just say an array can rotate k times towards right). Order of the elements in the output doesnâ€™t matter.

```
Input: arr[] = { 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2 }
Output: 9 4

Input: arr[] = {-9, -8, 4, 4, 5, 5, -1}
Output: -9 -8 -1
```
