## Given an array arr[0 . . . n-1]. We need to efficiently find the minimum and maximum value from index qs (query start) to qe (query end) where 0 <= qs <= qe <= n-1. We are given multiple queries.

```
Input : arr[] = {1, 8, 5, 9, 6, 14, 2, 4, 3, 7}
        queries = 5
        qs = 0 qe = 4
        qs = 3 qe = 7
        qs = 1 qe = 6
        qs = 2 qe = 5
        qs = 0 qe = 8
Output: Minimum = 1 and Maximum = 9 
        Minimum = 2 and Maximum = 14 
        Minimum = 2 and Maximum = 14 
        Minimum = 5 and Maximum = 14
        Minimum = 1 and Maximum = 14
```
