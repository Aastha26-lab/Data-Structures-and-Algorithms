## Given an array of non-negative numbers(of Integer Range), they are needed to be arranged in some order such that it gives the max number. For example given array is A[1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4, 12, 121]. if we arrange these numbers in the following order, A[9, 98, 76, 45, 4, 34, 3, 12, 121, 1], then by joining them we get “99876454343121211” as largest number.

```
Input :  [1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4, 12, 121]
Output : 99876454343121211

Input :  [12, 121]
Output : 12121
