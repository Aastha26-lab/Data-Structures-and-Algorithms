## Given an array of N distinct integers. The task is to write a program to check if this array is sorted and rotated. A sorted array is not considered as sorted and rotated, i.e., there should at least one rotation.
```
Input : arr[] = { 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 }
Output : YES
The above array is sorted and rotated.
Sorted array: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. 
Rotating this sorted array clockwise 
by 3 positions, we get: { 3, 4, 5, 1, 2}

Input: arr[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 5}
Output: YES

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: NO
```
