```
Input : N = 5
        arr = [1, 1, 5, 4, 5]
        Q = 3
        1 3 2
        2 5 1
        3 5 5         
Output : No
         Yes
         Yes
Explanation :
For the first query, 2 does not exist between the indices 1 and 3.
For the second query, 1 exists between the indices 2 and 5.
For the third query, 5 exists between the indices 3 and 5.
