## Given two binary trees. We need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the non-null node will be used as the node of new tree.

```
Input: 
     Tree 1            Tree 2                  
       2                 3                             
      / \               / \                            
     1   4             6   1                        
    /                   \   \                      
   5                     2   7                  

Output: Merged tree:
         5
        / \
       7   5
      / \   \ 
     5   2   7
```
