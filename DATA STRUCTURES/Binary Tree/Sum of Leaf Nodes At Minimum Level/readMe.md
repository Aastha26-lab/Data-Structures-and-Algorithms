# Given a binary tree containing n nodes. The problem is to get the sum of all the leaf nodes which are at minimum level in the binary tree.

```
Input : 
              1
            /   \
           2     3
         /  \   /  \
        4   5   6   7
           /     \
          8       9

Output : 11
Leaf nodes 4 and 7 are at minimum level.
Their sum = (4 + 7) = 11.
