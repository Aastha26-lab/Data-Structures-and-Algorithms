## Given a binary tree containing n nodes. The problem is to find the sum of all the parent nodeâ€™s which have a child node with value x.
```
Input : Binary tree with x = 2:
        4        
       / \       
      2   5      
     / \ / \     
    7  2 2  3    
Output : 11

        4        
       / \       
      2   5      
     / \ / \     
    7  2 2  3    

The highlighted nodes (4, 2, 5) above
are the nodes having 2 as a child node.
```
