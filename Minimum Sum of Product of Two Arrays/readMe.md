## Find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size, given that k modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either be increased or decreased by 2.

### Input : ar[] = {1, 2, -3}
###         b[]  = {-2, 3, -5}
###          k = 5
### Output : -31
### Explanation:
### Here n = 3 and k = 5. 
### So, we modified a[2], which is -3 and 
### increased it by 10 (as 5 modifications are allowed).
### Final sum will be :
### (1 * -2) + (2 * 3) + (7 * -5)
###    -2    +    6    -    35
###              -31
### (which is the minimum sum of the array with given conditions)
### Input : a[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 4}
###         b[] = {3, 4, 2, 3, 2}
### Output : 25
### Explanation: 
### Here, total numbers are 5 and total modifications allowed are 3. So, modify a[1], which is 3 and decreased it by 6 (as 3 modifications are allowed).
### Final sum will be :
### (2 * 3) + (-3 * 4) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (4 * 2)
###    6    â€“    12    +    8    +    15   +    8
                        25
### (which is the minimum sum of the array with given conditions)
