## Given an array of integer numbers, we need to sort this array in a minimum number of steps where in one step we can insert any array element from its position to any other position.
```
Input  : arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6]
Output : 3
We can sort above array in 3 insertion 
steps as shown below,
1 before array value 2
4 before array value 5
6 before array value 7

Input : arr[] = {4, 6, 5, 1}
Output : 2
```
