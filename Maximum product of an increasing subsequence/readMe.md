## Given an array of numbers, find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.

### Input : arr[] = { 3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6 }
### Output : 45000
### Maximum product is 45000 formed by the 
### increasing subsequence 3, 100, 150. Note
### that the longest increasing subsequence 
### is different {3, 4, 5, 6}

### Input : arr[] = { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60 }
### Output : 21780000
### Maximum product is 21780000 formed by the 
### increasing subsequence 10, 22, 33, 50, 60.
